SSPS: Software Deployment Module
============

This is source code repository for the Software Deployment Module (SDM).

SDM is a simple, multi-platform, package manager. It helps developers and configuration management personnel to automate
the jobs related to install software packages. It allows you to perform the same procedures no matter what OS you are
running. SDM is focused on custom software, in-house or enterprise applications that may not be suitable for
distribution using RPM, APT, nix, portage and many other package managers. SDM aims to be simple: as simple as possible
to deploy custom software, without requiring elevated privileges (root, Administrator, etc).
